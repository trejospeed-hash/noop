// MARK: - Export a recorded GPS route through Shortcuts (#2679)
//
// Route export already ships as a share sheet on the workout detail screen (`WorkoutDetailView`'s
// "GPX - Strava, Garmin, most apps"), and the same file is what Strava, Garmin Connect and the rest
// read back as a timed activity. What it could not do was run unattended: every workout needed the
// sheet opened by hand.
//
// This exposes the SAME renderer to Shortcuts, so an automation can take the file and hand it to
// whichever app the wearer already uses. NOOP gains no account, no credential and no network call:
// the file leaves only when the wearer's own automation moves it, exactly like the share sheet.
// Issue #2679 records why a direct Strava API client is a separate scope decision rather than this.
//
// It reads `RouteStore` (the UserDefaults side-store, since `WorkoutRow` has no route column on
// Apple) rather than the database, so it needs no store handle and cannot contend with a running
// sync. An App Intent declared in the app target runs in NOOP's own process, so the plain
// `UserDefaults` suite `RouteStore` writes is readable here.

/// Why an export can fail. Only one case: a route either carries the per-point measurements an
/// honest export needs, or it does not. Conforms to `CustomLocalizedStringResourceConvertible` so
/// Shortcuts shows the reason instead of a generic failure.
