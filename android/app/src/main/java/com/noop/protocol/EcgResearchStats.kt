 * #891 / #1100: PURE, NON-DIAGNOSTIC protocol statistics over a captured MG ECG research session.

 * Everything here is a shape/timing observation about bytes on a wire — packet rates, payload sizes,
 * zero-fill, which byte positions move between records. NOTHING here interprets a waveform, and the
 * vocabulary is deliberately neutral: a fast integer stream is a "candidate high-rate signal", never "the
 * ECG". Provenance of any waveform is a question for a human reading the raw bytes, not a statistic.
 *
 * Pure (no Android, no I/O, no clock): every input is passed in, so the whole file is unit-tested without a
 * strap. Consumed by [EcgResearchLog] to build `stats.json` for the export bundle.

     * ## The trap this is written around (#194)
     *
     * The strap's raw records carry a FIXED sample count ([Whoop5Ecg.SAMPLES_PER_RAW_RECORD] = 101). Anything
     * that repeats per record — a constant sub-header, a re-sent block, a seam where two records join — is
     * periodic at the record period, and at 100 Hz that period is 1.01 s == 59.4 bpm: inside this search band
     * and inside resting heart-rate range. An autocorrelation fed a concatenated record stream will therefore
     * report a confident ~59 bpm out of pure framing, with no cardiac content at all. That is the exact
     * [excludeLag] is REQUIRED and has no default, which is the whole point of it. Passing the record
     * period switches the guard on; passing null says "this source is not record-tiled" and accepts an
     * unguarded estimate. Both are defensible, but only as a decision somebody made: with a default the
     * shortest call, `estimateBpm(samples, fs)`, silently selected the unguarded form, and on a tiled
     * 101-sample record at 100 Hz that form returns 59 — a believable resting rate manufactured from a
     * buffer holding no rhythm at all. That is #194 exactly, and a wrong number nobody chose is the
     * failure this whole method is shaped around. Requiring the argument costs one word at each call site
     * and makes the unguarded path impossible to take by accident.
     *
     * failure mode behind NOOP's withdrawn PPG->HR estimate, so when [excludeLag] is supplied:
     *
     *  1. lags within [excludeLagTolerance] of it cannot win, and
     *  2. the winner must also beat the strength AT the artefact lag ([artefactDominance]). Step 1 alone is
     *     not enough — a broad peak centred on the artefact lag still has strong shoulders just outside the
     *     notch, so a notch by itself just reports the artefact as a slightly different number.
     *
     * The cost is stated rather than hidden: a genuine heart rate that lands in that narrow band is
     * indistinguishable from the artefact and is therefore DECLINED. Null means "this method cannot tell",
     * never "no rhythm".
     *
     * ## Two things that made an earlier version wrong
     *
     * - **Comparability across lags.** A raw lag product sums over `n - lag` terms, so longer lags accumulate
     *   fewer terms and score lower for arithmetic rather than physiological reasons. Each lag is scored as a
     *   true normalised cross-correlation over its own overlap, so lags are comparable and [minStrength]
     *   means the same thing everywhere.
     * - **Octave errors.** A periodic signal correlates just as well at twice its period, and with a
     *   non-integer number of cycles the double-period lag can score marginally higher — reporting 55 bpm for
     *   a 110 bpm input. So the winner is the SHORTEST lag within [octaveTolerance] of the best score, not
     *   the argmax.
