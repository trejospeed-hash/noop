/*
 * Frame envelope handling: reassembly of BLE fragments, validation, decode, and command building.
 *
 * Ported from the hardware-verified Swift reference (Framing.swift / Interpreter.swift /
 * PostHooks.swift). The Whoop 4.0 envelope is:
 *
 *   [0]      SOF 0xAA
 *   [1..2]   length u16 LE
 *   [3]      CRC8 over the two length bytes
 *   [4]      packet type
 *   [5]      seq
 *   [6]      cmd / event / meta-type (type-dependent)
 *   [7..]    payload
 *   [len..]  CRC32 (zlib, LE) over frame[4..<length], 4 bytes;  total frame = length + 4
 *
 * The Whoop 5.0 ("puffin") envelope differs (CRC16-Modbus header, inner record at offset 8); it is
 * validated/decoded here for completeness, with biometric field offsets deferred (the inner record
 * is exposed but HR/RR/battery decoding for WHOOP5 is a later milestone, matching the Swift port).
