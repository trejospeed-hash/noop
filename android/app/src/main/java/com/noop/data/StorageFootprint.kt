/**
 * #1911: estimated payload bytes per decoded stream table. Swift twin: `WhoopStore.storageByteEstimates`,
 * and meta.json's `row_bytes` block beside `rows`.
 *
 * Rows alone cannot say which table holds a large store. `ppgWaveformSample` stores a BLOB whose size
 * varies, and it is both the table a per-second row model misprices worst and the one this question is
 * usually about — so the estimate MEASURES the blob rather than assuming a fixed row width.
 *
 * A hand-written class over [WhoopDatabase] rather than a method on [WhoopRepository], following
 * [com.noop.push.PushDao]: the repository takes a DAO and a transactor precisely so its writes stay
 * testable without a Room runtime, and raw per-table SQL needs the open helper. Keeping it out preserves
 * that boundary instead of quietly widening it for a diagnostic.

    /**
     * Payload bytes per table, keyed exactly as `WhoopRepository.storageRowCounts` keys, so a maintainer
     * comparing meta.json across platforms is comparing the same two maps.
     *
     * `typeof()` at runtime rather than the declared type, and byte length via `CAST(... AS BLOB)` rather
     * than `length()`: SQLite is dynamically typed, so a column declared INTEGER can hold text, and
     * `length()` on text counts CHARACTERS while the store spends bytes. The same shape
     * `PushSnapshotPreflight.rowEstimateExpression` uses, without its JSON-expansion factors — this
     * measures the database, not a snapshot of it.
     *
     * Sampled over [sampleRows] rows and multiplied by the count, never scanned: a full sum over a
     * multi-gigabyte store is exactly the read this diagnostic exists to help someone avoid. The limit is
     * clamped because SQLite reads a NEGATIVE limit as no limit at all, which would full-scan every table
     * — the precise cost the sampling avoids, reached by a number that reads like it asks for less work.
     *
     * Payload only: no index pages, no page slack, no WAL. Read it against `db_bytes`, not as a second
     * file size. An unreadable or empty table is omitted rather than reported as zero, matching the row
     * counts — absent means "nothing to attribute here", which is not a measured zero.
     *
     * Suspending, and explicitly on IO. The callers launch the storage probe on the UI scope (the Test
     * Centre screen says so in its own doc), and Room's suspend DAO methods hop to its query executor for
     * free — a raw-query helper like this one does not, so without the switch these PRAGMA and AVG reads
     * would run on the main thread, over the multi-gigabyte store this diagnostic exists for.
