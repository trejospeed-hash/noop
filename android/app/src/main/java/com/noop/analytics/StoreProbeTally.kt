/**
 * How much of an `analyzeRecent` pass goes into its per-day PROBE queries, as calls and milliseconds.
 * Kotlin twin of the Swift `StoreProbeTally`.
 *
 * The blind spot this closes: with the steps-calibration fold now reused rather than recomputed, a warm
 * pass still reported ~3.3 s in the steps phase with `stepsMotion reused=60/60` beside it, so the fold was
 * provably not the cost and nothing said what was. The phase is bracketed as one number and sits outside
 * the #1538 day-loop tally, so the remaining candidates — the sixty per-day probe queries, the one
 * `appleDaily` read, and the in-memory calibration fit — were indistinguishable from each other.
 *
 * These are counted one level down rather than at the call site, so the counts attribute themselves with no
 * bookkeeping. Every one of them has exactly ONE caller here, since [IntelligenceEngine.resolveDayOwner] is
 * private to this object, so a Kotlin line describes exactly one pass. The Swift twin is one-sidedly
 * looser: its resolver is also called by a manual Test Centre skin-temp backfill, which can land in a
 * concurrent pass's line. The call count is what reveals that, which is one reason it prints.
 * - `dayOwner`: [com.noop.data.DeviceRegistry.dayOwner], the resolver's LOCKED-override lookup, which runs
 *   on every call before any presence probe. Measured because the first cut of this instrumentation counted
 *   the probe and not the lookup in front of it, and so reported the cheap half of owner resolution while a
 *   warm pass still had seconds unaccounted for.
 * - `ownerHr`: [com.noop.data.WhoopRepository.hasHrInWindow], the day-owner resolver's per-candidate
 *   presence probe. Runs in BOTH the scoring loop and the sixty-day steps loop, and is skipped entirely on
 *   a default single-strap install (#970), so a two-strap library is the only one that pays it.
 * - `gravityFp`: [com.noop.data.WhoopRepository.gravityFingerprintWindow], the steps loop's per-day motion
 *   witness. Steps-only.
 *
 * Read with the `stepsMotion reused=N/M` line, this is decisive rather than suggestive: a warm pass that
 * folded nothing and still spent its time here means the round trips ARE the cost and batching them into a
 * grouped query is worth building; one that does not means the cost is the `appleDaily` read or the fit,
 * and batching would have bought nothing. Measured, not guessed.
 *
 * Counted in the repository rather than at the call site for a mechanical reason: `analyzeRecentOnCpu` sits
 * 210 bytes under the JaCoCo method-size ratchet [IntelligenceEngineJacocoBudgetTest] holds, and the steps
 * loop is inside it. Timing there would cost more than the margin, and the ratchet's own note says to
 * extract rather than raise it. Counting one level down costs the budgeted method nothing at all, and the
 * reset and the emit both live in the unbudgeted `analyzeRecent` wrapper.
 *
 * Instrumentation only: nothing reads these counts but the log line.
