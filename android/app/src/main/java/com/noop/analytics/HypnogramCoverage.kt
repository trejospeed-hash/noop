/**
 * How much of a sleep session's `[startTs, endTs)` span its stage segments actually account for.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. A session's stage timeline is supposed to TILE its span — `SleepStageTotals` says so
 * explicitly ("the segment stages noop stores ... TILE the window ... Σ stage minutes equals the clock
 * span"), and every consumer is written as though it does. One producer breaks that invariant: a
 * device-PROVIDED hypnogram assembled from records that arrived INCOMPLETE. The Oura path
 * ([com.noop.oura.OuraSleepSessionMapping]) merges only CONTIGUOUS codes, so a sleep-phase page that
 * never arrived leaves a hole in `stagesJSON` while `startTs`/`endTs` still span the whole night. The
 * result is a session that looks well-formed — non-empty, many segments, a plausible efficiency — but
 * describes a fraction of the night it claims.
 *
 * Measured on 31 consecutive ring nights, 8 of them came in under 95% and one covered 23% of its own
 * span (601 min claimed, 140 min of segments). Downstream that night was stored as 70 minutes of sleep
 * against a paired strap's 494, and nothing flagged it: the merge's richness rule tests only that stages
 * are PRESENT, and Rest's two confidence guards are `gravitySparse` (inert here — Oura stores no gravity
 * at all, so `isGravitySparse` returns false for every ring night) and the #H9 restorative floor (needs
 * efficiency >= 0.85; the holed night read 0.50).
 *
 * So the missing quantity is not a new measurement — it is a RATIO of two numbers already stored.
 * Nothing here is persisted and no migration is needed: coverage is derived on read, which also means it
 * applies retroactively to nights already in the database.
 *
 * HONEST-DATA: this only ever reports how much of the night was OBSERVED. It never fills a hole in, and
 * in particular it must not let a caller treat unobserved time as awake — we do not know what happened
 * there, and asserting wake would be the same overreach in the opposite direction.
 *
 * PARITY: pure + deterministic, byte-identical to the Swift twin (`WhoopStore.HypnogramCoverage`). Keep
 * the two in lockstep; `HypnogramCoverageTest` pins the ratio against a Swift-generated oracle.

     * fields that are independent of the `items` array it builds those segments from. A Xiaomi night
     * whose items do not reach its own bed/wake bounds IS judged holed here. That is arguably the right
     * answer — the night genuinely is only partly described — but it is a real behaviour change for
     * that importer, unvalidated against a Xiaomi export, and it is pinned by test rather than left to
