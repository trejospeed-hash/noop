/**
 * Coach settings, split out of [CoachScreen] so the coach tab is the conversation and nothing else
 * (#2243). Holds the three surfaces that used to sit above the transcript: the data-sharing consent,
 * the editable coach instructions, and the morning brief.
 *
 * Connection management (the provider pill and Disconnect) deliberately stays on [CoachScreen].
 * Disconnect is the only route back to the setup card, which is the only place a key can be typed,
 * and #2206 is the iOS version of what happens when that control is put somewhere the screen does
 * not render.
 *
 * The first-run setup card deliberately stays on [CoachScreen]. It is the only route to a working
 * coach, and someone who has not connected a provider arrives on the Coach tab, not here, so moving
 * it would leave that screen an empty chat with no way out.
 *
 * NOT a card-for-card twin of `CoachSettingsView`, which carries five. The two further opt-ins this
 * screen lacks are a pre-existing divergence, not part of the #2243 move: the on-device-signals toggle
 * already lives on the main Settings screen on Android (NoopPrefs.coachSignals, read by both
 * CoachViewModel.send and CoachBriefScheduler), and the Gemini multimodal chart has no Android UI at
 * all, only the unread NoopPrefs.coachMultimodal stub. Worth folding in, separately.
 *
 * Reached by the strip on the coach page rather than from the More drawer: the drawer groups mirror
 * the iOS More list one-for-one, and this hangs off Coach on both platforms instead. Swift twin:
 * `CoachSettingsView`.

// against a second instance persisted to storage and still left the conversation sending on the old

/**
 * Which model answers, and the control that refreshes the list of them.
 *
 * This lives HERE rather than on the setup card because of where a key exists. The setup card renders
 * only while `isConfigured` is false, which for a cloud provider means no key is stored, and the
 * Refresh control is gated on having one: `enabled = hasKey` inside a screen that only appears when
 * `!hasKey` can never be true. So for OpenAI, Anthropic and Gemini that button was permanently
 * disabled, and the live catalogue those three publish was unreachable. A key exists by definition on
 * this screen, so both the picker and the refresh work.
 *
 * The PROVIDER deliberately stays on the setup card. A stored key records which provider it belongs to
 * and is never sent anywhere else (AiKeyStore.read(ctx, provider)), so switching provider here would
 * leave a key that cannot be used and a screen that cannot fix it.
