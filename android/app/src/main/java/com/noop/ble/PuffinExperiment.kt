 * Opt-in switch for the EXPERIMENTAL WHOOP 5.0/MG ("puffin") protocol probes.
 *
 * Direct port of the macOS `PuffinExperiment` (Strand/BLE/PuffinExperiment.swift). Live HR on a
 * 5/MG strap already works over the standard profile after CLIENT_HELLO. These probes go further —
 * sending puffin-framed commands (e.g. asking the strap to start its realtime stream) to learn what
 * a real 5/MG strap responds to. They are guesses, so they are OFF by default and only ever written
 * to the puffin command characteristic (fd4b0002). A 5/MG owner can flip this on under Settings →
 * Experimental to help map the protocol; everyone else is unaffected. It never touches WHOOP 4.0.
 *
 * The macOS app stored this in `UserDefaults` under the key `noopPuffinExperiments`; the Android
 * equivalent is [SharedPreferences]. The same key name is reused for parity.
