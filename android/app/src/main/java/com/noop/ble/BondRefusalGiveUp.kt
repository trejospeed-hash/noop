/**
 * Mirror of the Swift `BondRefusalGiveUp` (Strand/BLE/BLEManager.swift).
 *
 * #747 / #750: decides when a strap that keeps REFUSING the encrypted bond
 * (INSUFFICIENT_AUTHENTICATION/_ENCRYPTION, no genuine bond in between) has refused enough times that
 * hammering it further is pointless. Two responsibilities, both pure so they're unit-testable without a
 * BLE seam:
 *
 *  - #747 PAUSE: after [giveUpThreshold] consecutive refusals the auto-reconnect should STOP re-kicking
 *    (it can't bond without the user freeing the strap / re-pairing), so the caller pauses the rescan and
 *    surfaces an honest hint instead of looping forever and draining the battery.
 *  - #750 EPITAPH: at the same moment, emit ONE summary "epitaph" line recording how the bond attempt
 *    died (the streak + an opaque, install-local id), so a shared strap log carries the cause without any
 *    PII (no MAC, no serial, just the count and a short opaque token).
 *
 * The streak accumulates across the reconnect loop (a disconnect does NOT reset it) and is cleared only by
 * a genuine bond or an explicit user reconnect, exactly like the client's existing [bondRefusalStreak].
