/**
 * Diagnosis for the frame-integrity gate: what a rejected frame still tells us, and how often each
 * reason occurred on one connection. Kotlin twin of `FrameDiagnostics.swift` in `WhoopProtocol`.
 *
 * It lives beside the BLE client rather than in `com.noop.protocol` because the tally is a per-
 * connection diagnostic of the link, not a property of the wire format — and because the one thing
 * that must stay literally identical across the platforms is what it PRINTS, which is pinned by the
 * tests below it, not by where the class sits.
 *
 * Naming note: Swift spells the named counter `payloadCRCOKButEnvelopeRejected`. This side follows the
 * repository's established Kotlin twin casing (`crcOk` for Swift's `crcOK`, as `ParsedFrame` already
 * does) for the PROPERTY, while the emitted strings are byte-identical to the Swift ones — the log
 * line is the shared artefact a reader compares across two field reports, the identifier is not.

/**
 * Whether the decoder got a PACKET TYPE out of this frame — the parseability question, which is NOT
 * the integrity question [ParsedFrame.ok] answers.
 *
 * The two used to be the same value, so every diagnostic surface that wanted "did this decode?" read
 * `ok`. Now `ok` means "header checksum, payload CRC32 and structural length all agree", and reading
 * it as parseability would blank the packet type of exactly the frames a capture exists to map: a
 * frame with a flipped header byte still decodes its type, its sequence number and its fields, and
 * losing that in the record is losing the evidence.

/**
 * Per-reason rejection counters for one connection, plus the ONE extra named counter the hardware run

 *
 * Why a plain per-reason count is not enough (D3): the abort criterion for the hardware run is a
 * CONJUNCTION — "header checksum or length wrong WHILE the payload CRC32 verifies" — and no single
 * reason bucket can express it. The length bucket in particular also collects the harmless resyncs
 * after a lost notification, which were happening before this change too. So
 * [payloadCrcOkButEnvelopeRejected] is counted separately; it is the class that used to pass, and thus
 * the cleanest regression signal.
 *
 * Counted per reason only — NOT additionally per device family. A connection talks to exactly one
 * strap, so a family dimension would be constant.
 *
 * A tally asserts only what it observed. Structural failures retain a null CRC diagnostic when the
 * declared payload cannot be checked; only a computed, disagreeing checksum is a payload mismatch.
 *
 * Not thread-safe on its own: the BLE client mutates it only from the GATT binder thread that feeds
 * the reassembler, and reads it on the same thread at teardown.
