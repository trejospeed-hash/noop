/**
 * Why a 5/MG link reaches "live HR works, nothing ever syncs" — said once, in the log, instead of left
 * to be reconstructed from four separate lines that each state only part of it.
 *
 * The field log that motivated this file contained every fact needed to explain a strap that had not
 * banked a row in three days, and none of them said so. `Backfill: deferred — connect handshake not done
 * yet` repeated with no state; the hello's absence was visible only as a line that never appeared; and
 * the deferral that caused it returned silently. Reading it required knowing that `connectHandshakeDone`
 * is gated on `didBond` for WHOOP5 and not for WHOOP4, that the handshake tail is what sends SET_CLOCK,
 * and that an un-clocked 5/MG discards its own sensor data. That is too much reconstruction to ask of a
 * capture, and it is the reconstruction that has to happen fastest when someone reports lost data.
 *
 * These builders are pure so the wording is testable and cannot drift from what the counters mean. The
 * counters they render live in `WhoopBleClient` and are per app process — the honest limit of an
 * in-memory bound, and the same one [overrideHelloStillAllowed] documents. The loops these describe run
 * within one process; a restart is not the failure mode.
 */

/**
 * The hello was not written on this link because a `createBond()` was asked for first.
 *
 * [ExplicitBond] already explains why that deferral never resolves on a strap answering SMP 0x05: the
 * next connect requests a bond too, and defers again. What it could not do is say so at runtime — the
 * deferral branch returns without a word, so a capture shows a hello that simply never happens, with the
 * reason inferable only from an `explicitBondRequestLine` promising a "next connect" that reads
 * identically on the first deferral and the fiftieth.
 *
 * [consecutive] is what makes it diagnosable. One deferral is the experiment working as designed; a
 * number climbing across every connect is the permanent state, and the difference between those two is
 * the entire question. Printing the count converts "why is there no hello" into one line.
 *
 * The override's state rides along because it is the only thing that breaks the cycle, and a reader who
 * sees the deferral will immediately want to know whether the escape hatch is on and whether it has
 * budget left. Naming a spent override explicitly stops it reading as an untried option.

 * offered in full and inserted as zero is precisely the failure that otherwise reads like success.
 *
 * [standardHrHostReceivedLine], which this block documents, is the earliest of them. Apple emits it
