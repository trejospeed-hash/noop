/**
 * Whether to send the WHOOP 5/MG CLIENT_HELLO at all on this connect.
 *
 * The #1635 field captures show the hello is what ends the link. Across two sessions and sixteen writes it
 * was never once acknowledged, and the drop is locked to the HELLO rather than to the connect: 3.158s,
 * 3.159s, 3.155s after the write, cycle after cycle, while live HR streams happily over the standard
 * profile the whole time. The bond-state trace added for this (#1639) records no OS pairing attempt at all
 * — the write simply never completes and the local stack drops the ACL, which the log reports as an
 * unattributed GATT status 22.
 *
 * That trace was later read as "the strap is not refusing a pairing". An HCI capture disproves it: the
 * phone DOES transmit an SMP Pairing Request and the strap answers `Pairing Not Supported` (0x05). The
 * refusal is real, and it is categorical — the encrypted bond this hello was waiting behind can never
 * arrive on a 5/MG. That does not invalidate the suppression, whose evidence is about the hello's own
 * fate, but it does mean suppressing it leaves the app attempting NEITHER handshake. Hence the opt-in
 * override below.
 *
 * The result is a strap that CAN deliver live HR being knocked off every five seconds by a handshake that
 * has never once succeeded. Suppressing the hello after the give-up latches trades an unreachable
 * capability (puffin commands, history offload) for one that demonstrably works (continuous live HR) —
 * the "Live HR, not fully paired" state the app already models (#69), reached deliberately instead of
 * never at all.
 *
 * [userInitiated] always re-attempts: suppression is a fallback for automatic reconnects, never a
 * permanent verdict. Someone who puts the strap in pairing mode and presses Connect must get a fresh try.
 * That try is ONE connect's worth and nothing more — the latch itself survives the tap, so if the strap
 * still will not answer, the automatic reconnects behind it stay suppressed instead of re-earning the
 * give-up over five more refusals. The latch is dropped by a genuine bond (it demonstrably works now) or
 * by forgetting the strap, which are the two events that are actually evidence about this device.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT re-armed by "an OS pairing exists". That looks right — a pairing is new evidence the
 * handshake might work — but the condition never goes away, so a strap that pairs and STILL will not
 * answer would have the latch bypassed on every connect for good: hello, drop at ~4.8s, reconnect,
 * forever, with the give-up powerless to stop it. That is the unbounded loop this suppression exists to
 * end, reintroduced through the back door. The explicit-bond experiment instead clears the latch ONCE at
 * the moment it asks for a pairing, which is self-limiting: the next failure re-latches and the condition
 * to clear it again does not recur.

 * deliberate suppressed-hello live-HR state, but the raw pref reported the hello as still being sent, so
