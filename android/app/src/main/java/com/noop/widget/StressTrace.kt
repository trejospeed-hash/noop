/**
 * The pure half of the stress widget: what the trace CONTAINS and where its ink goes.
 *
 * Split from the drawing for the same reason as [HrTrace] — Glance compiles to RemoteViews, which has
 * no Canvas, so a chart can only reach a widget as a Bitmap, and a Bitmap is not something a JVM test
 * can meaningfully assert about. Everything decidable without a Canvas lives here and is unit-tested.
 *
 * TWO THINGS DIFFER FROM [HrTrace], and both are deliberate.
 *
 * The domain is FIXED at 0-3, not normalised to the day's own min and max. Heart rate has no absolute
 * meaning at widget size, so its trace spreads whatever range it has across the full box. A stress
 * score does have one: the bands are what the number means, and [DOMAIN_MAX] is the top of the scale
 * the app scores against everywhere else. Normalising here would redraw a flat calm day as a dramatic
 * one, which is precisely the lie the fixed domain exists to prevent.
 *
 * And the series is REPLACED rather than appended to. The HR trace folds a live push into a rolling
 * window; today's stress is a whole scored day that arrives complete each time analysis runs, so there
 * is no retention rule to get right, no clock-jump guard, and no cap. Yesterday's trace is not merged
 * into today's, it is simply overwritten.
 *
 * Also the shape an iOS twin would share. SwiftUI draws directly so the renderer will not port, but the
 * domain, the gap rule and the tick choices are the same decisions on both platforms and should not be
 * made twice.

     * THE LEVEL IS WRITTEN LOSSLESSLY (#2166). This used to be `"%.2f"`, which made the snapshot a
     * rounding step in front of a rounding: the widget printed a level that had been rounded to two

     * disagreed by a tenth on 5% of levels, and the same skew reached the peak and average, which are

     * A span runs edge to edge of the hours it covers, NOT centre to centre. An hour is a stretch of the

     * lone masked hour a width of zero, which is exactly the hour that most needs to be legible, since

     * neighbour rather than as a fixed slot, so an irregular series (a DST-long day, an hour missing
     * from the list entirely) still gets honest extents. At the ends of the series the territory stops
     * at the point itself: the day's extent is what was sampled, and nothing is invented past it, which
     * also keeps every span inside the box without a clamp.
     *
     * The upper edge is floored to the lower one. On a sorted series it never binds, but the two
     * platforms disagree about what an inverted range means, Kotlin yielding an empty one where Swift
     * traps, and a twin that crashes on one side and shrugs on the other is not a twin.
