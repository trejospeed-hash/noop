/**
 * Oracle test for the SpO2 channel resolver and its strap-log line.
 *
 * WHY AN ORACLE AND NOT A HAND-WRITTEN EXPECTATION. The defect this whole type fixes was two numbers
 * three orders of magnitude apart being printed under the same words. Two platforms hand-writing
 * "what we call this channel" is how that comes back — one side says "perfusion", the other "DC", and
 * nobody notices until a reporter pastes a log and is told the wrong thing. So the literals below are
 * NOT written by hand: they are the verbatim stdout of the SHIPPED Swift function, captured with
 *
 *     swift build   # in Packages/OuraProtocol
 *     swiftc -O -I <build>/Products/Debug -L <build>/Products/Debug -lOuraProtocol main.swift -o oracle
 *     ./oracle
 *
 * where main.swift prints `value|unit|channel.rawValue|OuraSpO2Channel.firstDecodedLogLine(value:unit:)`
 * for each row. The last five rows are unit tags no decoder stamps: they resolve to `unknown` and carry
 * no `%`. Re-capture and re-paste if the Swift side ever changes; do not edit these by eye.
 *
 * NOTE ON DIRECTION: this guards Kotlin against the Swift of the day. `OuraSpO2ChannelTests` on the
 * Swift side pins the same dispositions, which is what stops Swift drifting silently.
