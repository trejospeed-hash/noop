 * Regression guard for #421: the MAC scrubber regex has exactly two capture groups (first + last
 * octet), so the replacement must reference $1/$2. A stray `$3` made `replace()` throw
 * IndexOutOfBoundsException("No group 3") the instant a raw MAC was logged — which happened the
 * moment a generic-HR strap (Polar H10 etc.) was activated, since StandardHrSource logs
 * `device.address`. The thrown exception aborted the strap's activation, so the strap never streamed.
