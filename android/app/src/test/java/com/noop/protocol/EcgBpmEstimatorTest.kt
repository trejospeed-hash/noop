/**
 * #891/#1100 + the #194 lesson: [EcgResearchStats.estimateBpm].
 *
 * The repo's rule for deriving a physiological signal from raw sensor data is that a single match proves
 * nothing — the method has to track a VARYING input, and for a synthetic test that means recovering SEVERAL
 * injected values rather than one. The previous test injected one rate. This injects a spread, and then
 * attacks the estimator with the specific artefact that got the earlier PPG->HR estimate withdrawn: the
 * strap's records carry a fixed 101 samples, so a seam between records is periodic at ~59 bpm all by itself.
