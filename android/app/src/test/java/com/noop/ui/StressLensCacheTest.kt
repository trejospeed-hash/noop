/**
 * The personal daytime-stress lens is resolved once per local day, not once per surface.
 *
 * The drain (#2535): with the lens on, a wearer saw Today showing 09:30 at 22:20 while Stress detail showed
 * the current curve fifteen seconds after opening. Both are the same latency. The resolver folds the thirty
 * days BEFORE today, and every surface paid that fold independently: Today's fifteen-minute loop, detail on
 * open, the widget pass. Today's loop is gated on STARTED so it suspends while backgrounded and scores on
 * resume, and the card holds its previous curve while that runs, so the morning's curve stayed on screen
 * looking current for as long as the fold took.
 *
 * The span ends YESTERDAY, which is what makes the memo sound: today's heart rate arrives all day and
 * cannot move the key.
