/// The words and phase the strap-sync Live Activity shows, resolved here — platform-neutral, no
/// ActivityKit — so the mapping is covered by `StrandTests` (which runs on the macOS leg only). The iOS
/// controller turns a `Line` into the activity's content state; the widget renders the strings as-is.
///
/// Same honesty rules as `SyncChipState.resolve`: a chunk COUNT rather than a percent (the strap never
/// says how much is pending), a zero backlog dropped rather than rendered, and "interrupted" only when
/// `LiveState.lastSyncError` says the idle watchdog ended the offload — every other end completed.
