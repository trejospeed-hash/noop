// The live session, owned ABOVE any screen.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The session used to live inside the sheet that displayed it. Swiping that sheet
// down dismissed it, which tore down the view — and with it the strap's double-tap handler and the
// rest-timer tick. The session looked alive (it was still on disk, and "Resume" brought it back) but
// was deaf: taps did nothing, no buzz arrived, in the app or out of it. Re-entering also re-fired
// the five-second warning, because the "already buzzed" flag was view state that reset on every
// present.
//
// A workout outlives the screen you happen to be looking at, so the session has to as well. This
// controller owns the engine, the tick, the buzz gating and the persistence. The sheet is a
// rendering of it; the bottom bar is another. Dismissing either changes nothing about the session.
//
// The strap gesture is claimed for the LIFETIME OF THE SESSION rather than the lifetime of a view,
// and handed back untouched when the session ends.
