// Display names for the stored `LiftMuscle` vocabulary.
//
// `WhoopStore` deliberately holds no UI strings: `LiftMuscle`'s raw values are a stored-data
// contract (an Android twin must one day write byte-identical tokens), so the human-readable name
// has to live at the app layer, where it can be localized without touching what is written to the
// database. Renaming a label here is free; renaming a token is not — see the header of
// `LiftMuscle.swift`.
//
// Names are the ones lifters use, not the anatomical Latin: "Lats", not "latissimus dorsi". The
// vocabulary is meant to be picked from in a gym in a few seconds, and the granularity is already
// justified in the enum — the label's only job is to be recognised instantly.
