/// Process-level reuse of the resolved daytime-stress lens, keyed on the inputs that can change it.
///
/// The resolver folds the THIRTY DAYS BEFORE today, so its answer is fixed for the whole local day unless a
/// backfill lands rows inside that past window. Today's own heart rate, which arrives all day, is outside it
/// and cannot move the key. Without this memo every surface paid the full fold independently: Today's hosted
/// card, Stress detail on open, and each foreground pass, all reading up to thirty days of HR.
///
/// The drain it closes (#2535, reported on Android): with the lens on, Today showed 09:30 at 22:20 while
/// detail showed the current curve fifteen seconds after opening. Both are the same latency, and the card
/// holds its previous curve while a pass runs, so the morning's curve stayed on screen looking current.
///
/// `inFlight` is the half a plain memo misses, and on this platform it is also what makes the dedupe work at
/// all: a MainActor method that awaits is REENTRANT, so a second caller can arrive while the first is still
/// folding and would otherwise start its own. Sharing the task means the second awaits the first's answer.
///
/// In memory and per process, the same contract `AnalyzeRecentDayCache` keeps: never persisted, never across
/// the backup boundary, and a miss is byte-for-byte the full path. Nothing is banked from here, so there is
/// no data-loss surface.
///
/// ONE slot rather than a dictionary, deliberately: every caller resolves for the same active device and the
/// same local day, so a second slot would only hold a key nothing asks for again. Kotlin twin:
/// `com.noop.ui.StressLensCache`.
