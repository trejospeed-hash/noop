// The session state machine: the heart of the Lift Log.
//
// A GYM IS NOT A QUEUE. The first version walked the plan strictly in order, one set at a time, and
// the first real session killed that: when a machine is occupied you move on and come back. So the
// plan is a SHEET of slots — every set of every exercise, all visible — and any pending slot can be
// started at any time. Order is a suggestion the session follows by default, not a rail.
//
// PURE (no timers, no store, no SwiftUI): it is the piece most likely to be wrong in a way that
// costs someone a logged set, and the only part testable with no strap, no database, no simulator.
//
// TIME ENTERS ONLY AS A PARAMETER, so a test can drive a whole session through a known timeline.
// Rest is an ABSOLUTE end instant, never a decrementing counter — a phone that sleeps through a rest
// must wake up telling the truth.
//
// THERE IS NO COOL-DOWN STAGE. Warm-up is the time before the first set and cool-down the time after
// the last; both fall out of the timestamps, so neither needs a stage of its own. The session ends
// when the user says it does.

/// One set of one exercise — a position on the sheet. `setIndex` is 1-based within its exercise.
