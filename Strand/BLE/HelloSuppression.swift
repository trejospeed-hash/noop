///
/// The #1635 field captures show the hello is what ends the link. Across two sessions and sixteen writes it
/// was never once acknowledged, and the drop is locked to the HELLO rather than to the connect: 3.158s,
/// 3.159s, 3.155s after the write, cycle after cycle, while live HR streams happily over the standard
/// profile the whole time.
///
/// An HCI capture later established the cause: the phone transmits an SMP Pairing Request and the strap
/// answers `Pairing Not Supported` (0x05). The refusal is categorical — the encrypted bond this hello waits
/// behind can never arrive on a 5/MG — so the write is a handshake that has never once succeeded knocking a
/// strap that CAN deliver live HR off every few seconds.
///
/// Suppressing it after the give-up latches trades an unreachable capability (puffin commands, history
/// offload) for one that demonstrably works (continuous live HR) — the "Live HR, not fully paired" state
/// the app already models (#69), reached deliberately instead of never at all.
///
/// [userInitiated] always re-attempts: suppression is a fallback for automatic reconnects, never a
/// permanent verdict. Someone who puts the strap in pairing mode and presses Connect must get a fresh try.
/// That try is ONE connect's worth and nothing more — the latch itself survives the tap, so if the strap
/// still will not answer, the automatic reconnects behind it stay suppressed instead of re-earning the
/// give-up over five more refusals. The latch is dropped by a genuine bond (it demonstrably works now) or
/// by forgetting the strap, which are the two events that are actually evidence about this device.

///
/// An unanswered handshake gives the user nothing to act on. The write vanishes, the strap is not refusing
/// anything it could be talked out of, and the outcome — suppress the hello and keep streaming live HR —
/// needs no permission and costs no capability that was reachable anyway. Every cycle spent waiting is a
/// ~4.8s link drop bought for nothing, so this branch stops at 3.
///
/// Not 2, which is exactly where the pairing hint fires: a strap whose hello is unanswered twice by some
/// transient would latch a PERSISTED verdict with no margin at all. 3 keeps one cycle of margin and still

///  - An UNANSWERED HANDSHAKE means the write vanished. The link itself is healthy and streaming, so
///    pausing throws away working live HR to punish a handshake nobody is waiting on. Suppress the hello
///    and stay connected instead.

/// seconds later. The consequence is the loop #1635 describes, with nothing able to end it.
