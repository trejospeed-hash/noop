// Tap outside a field to put the keyboard away.
//
// The Lift Log's entry fields are numeric, so the keyboard has no return key to dismiss with, and
// the only way out was the "Done" toolbar button — which meant the keyboard sat over half the
// workout sheet until you found it. In a gym that is the difference between glancing at your next
// set and fighting the phone.
//
// A tap on ANOTHER FIELD is not a tap outside. The first version cleared focus from a SwiftUI
// `simultaneousGesture` on the whole screen, which also fired for a tap that landed in a field: the
// tapped field took focus and the gesture took it straight back, so moving from the weight to the
// reps took two taps — one to lose the keyboard, one to get it back (gym session, 16 Sep 2026).
// SwiftUI's tap gesture cannot say what it landed on, so the watcher is a UIKit recognizer that
// reads the touched view and stands aside for any text input.
//
// It never swallows a tap: the recognizer runs alongside everything else, so a tap on a button both
// dismisses the keyboard and does whatever it was aimed at — this screen's buttons advance the session.
