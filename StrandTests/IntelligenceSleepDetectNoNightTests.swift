/// Pins the "HR tracked but no sleep" diagnostic (#1244). When a day clears the >=200-HR gate yet the
/// stager detects NO in-bed session, the summary line only says `totalSleepMin=nil` with no clue why —
/// every other night trace (`rhr`/`rrsample`/`hrv diag`) emits only once a session exists. The engine now
/// ships one counts-only reason line naming the raw inputs the stager was handed, so the next capture
/// separates the causes (no motion vs coverage gap vs window). `sleepDetectNoNightLogLine` is the pure
/// formatter the loop calls; tested directly (no store). Mirrors the Android `sleepDetectNoNightLogLine`
/// so the two platforms log a byte-identical line.
