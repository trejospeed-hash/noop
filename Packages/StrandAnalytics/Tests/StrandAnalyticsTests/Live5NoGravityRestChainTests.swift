/// The no-gravity Rest chain, from bug #977 (iOS, WHOOP 5.0, live Bluetooth): "Rest score stuck 93 since
/// forever."
///
/// Renamed from `Live5RestFrozenTests`. The frozen state is closed (see below), and a file called
/// "Frozen" is the same stale signal the `XCTExpectFailure` in it used to be: something a reader greps,
/// believes, and acts on long after it stopped being true. #977 stays named here for archaeology; the
/// file is named for the chain it pins.
///
/// The mechanism: a LIVE WHOOP 5.0 streams standard 0x2A37 HR continuously, but gravity is only ever
/// populated by the *history offload* (Backfiller). With no overnight gravity the day reaches the scoring
/// loop with dense HR — it clears IntelligenceEngine's `hr.count >= 200` gate, so recovery/Charge still
/// score — while sleep detection finds nothing. No sleep means no `totalSleepMin`/`efficiency`, so
/// `AnalyticsEngine.Rest.composite(daily:)` is nil, so NO `sleep_performance` point is written, and the
/// Rest read-out has nothing new to show.
///
/// WHAT CHANGED SINCE THESE TESTS WERE WRITTEN, and why they are repinned rather than deleted:
///
///  • The V1 stager still bails without gravity (`grav.count < 2`). That is unchanged and still pinned
///    below — V1 is a selectable fallback (the 4.0 is unvalidated on either stager, #271/#319), so its
///    behaviour is worth stating, but it is no longer what a default install runs.
///  • The rescue is NOT inside `detectSleep` — neither stager finds a night without motion, and both are
///    pinned saying so below. It is in `IntelligenceEngine`: when a day has no motion, no hypnogram and
///    no stored night, it falls back to `SleepStager.hrOnlySessions(hr:rr:resp:)` (#1801) and feeds the
///    result in as `providedSleep`. #1884 then stopped an all-HR-only night being discarded from the
///    daily aggregates. So the shipping path DOES score a no-gravity night, which is precisely the
///    "HR-only fallback composite" the old fix-contract test named as one of two acceptable fixes.
///    That fallback is covered by `SleepStagerHrOnlySessionsTests` + `AnalyticsEngineHrOnlyDayTests`.
///
/// The old contract test asserted `Rest.composite(daily:)` on a hand-built row with no sleep fields and
/// wrapped it in `XCTExpectFailure`. That could never pass, whatever got fixed: a row with no aggregates
/// is nil BY DEFINITION, not by bug. It was testing the wrong layer. The chain is pinned at its two real
/// joints instead — does the shipping stager stage the night, and does a staged night yield a composite.
///
/// The display half (whether Today shows a stale carried value or falls through to its no-data state) is
/// #977's `freshRestScore` + `isCarryStale`, which live in the app target and are covered there and by
/// Android's `RestFreshnessTest`. This package pins only what it owns, and says so at the bottom of the
/// file rather than keeping a test that re-simulates a rule it cannot import.
