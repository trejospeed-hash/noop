/// How much of an `analyzeRecent` pass goes into its per-day PROBE queries, as calls and milliseconds.
///
/// The blind spot this closes: with the steps-calibration fold now reused rather than recomputed, a warm
/// pass still reported ~3.3 s in the steps phase with `stepsMotion reused=60/60` beside it, so the fold was
/// provably not the cost and nothing said what was. The phase is bracketed as one number and sits outside
/// the `#1538` day-loop tally, so the remaining candidates — the sixty per-day probe queries, the one
/// `appleDaily` read, and the in-memory calibration fit — were indistinguishable from each other.
///
/// Three lookups are worth counting, each measured one level down so the counts attribute themselves with
/// no bookkeeping at the call site. `gravityFp` has exactly one caller; the other two are one-sidedly
/// looser on Swift, where `resolveDayOwner` is also reached by a manual Test Centre skin-temp backfill and
/// can land in a concurrent pass's line. The call count is what reveals that, which is one reason it
/// prints. See `StoreProbeCounts`.
/// - `dayOwner`: `DeviceRegistryStore.dayOwner`, the resolver's LOCKED-override lookup, which runs on every
///   call ahead of any presence probe.
/// - `ownerHr`: `hasHrInWindow`, the day-owner resolver's per-candidate presence probe. Runs in BOTH the
///   scoring loop and the sixty-day steps loop, and is skipped entirely on a default single-strap install
///   (#970), so a two-strap library is the only one that pays it.
/// - `gravityFp`: `gravityFingerprint`, the steps loop's per-day motion witness. Steps-only.
///
/// Read with the `stepsMotion reused=N/M` line, this is decisive rather than suggestive: a warm pass that
/// folded nothing and still spent its time here means the round trips ARE the cost and batching them into a
/// grouped query is worth building; one that does not means the cost is the `appleDaily` read or the fit,
/// and batching would have bought nothing. Measured, not guessed — the same reason the day-loop split and
/// the day-cache duration are measured rather than reasoned about.
///
/// Instrumentation only: nothing reads these counts but the log line.
