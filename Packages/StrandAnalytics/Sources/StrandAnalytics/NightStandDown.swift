/// The hours of the local day in which a wearable's daytime-HR mode should stand down so the device can
/// run its own night suite — derived from the sleep schedule NOOP already learns, never from a fixed clock.
///
/// WHY THIS EXISTS. An Oura ring produces daytime heart rate ONLY while a client holds it in daytime-HR
/// mode (`DHR_mode:3`); there is no banked daytime HR family it emits on its own. NOOP's screen-off suspend
/// (#1526) stops holding the ring so its sleep suite can run — the right call at night, r = −0.93 between
/// the overnight hold and the ring producing SpO2 / a hypnogram / `0x6A` — but a screen-off gate is also
/// true for most of a working day, so from the night that build shipped the daytime 5-min HR bins went from
/// 123–144/144 to a median of ~16, and windowed rMSSD by day emptied with them (the daytime beats are the
/// same `0x80` records). This band is what lets the stand-down key on the NIGHT instead of on the screen.
///
/// Bedtime is `BatteryEstimator.bedtimeSec` and wake is midsleep `+ BatteryEstimator.halfNightSec`: the band
/// CALLS the arithmetic `BatteryEstimator.bedtimeAlert` calls rather than restating it, so the two policies
/// can never disagree about when the user's night is; the band then opens `leadSeconds` before that bedtime (an early night must still stand
/// down) and closes `tailSeconds` after that wake (a lie-in must not re-arm the hold). Cold start — fewer
/// nights than the learner needs — yields nil, and the caller falls back to the screen rule: inventing a
/// 23:00 band would hold or release the ring at the wrong hour for exactly the shift/late sleepers the
/// learner exists for. A nap outside the band is not stood down for; that is a known limit of this first cut.
///
/// Pure and clock-free so it is `swift test`-able like `BatteryEstimator.bedtimeAlert`.
