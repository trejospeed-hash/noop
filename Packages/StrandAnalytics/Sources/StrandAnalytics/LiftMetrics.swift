// Training metrics for the Lift Log.
//
// Every figure here is arithmetic the user can redo by hand from their own logged sets. That is the
// whole design constraint: NOOP shows a few honest numbers rather than one invented score, because a
// composite "workout score out of 100" feels satisfying and tells you nothing about what to change.
//
// PURE. No store, no clock, no UI — the inputs are rows and the outputs are numbers, so the whole
// surface is unit-testable with no strap, no database and no simulator.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT, and must stay absent:
//
//  • Anything that feeds `workout.strain` or daily Effort. NOOP's strain is HR-measured (Karvonen
//    %HRR -> Edwards TRIMP). There is no validated public path from typed sets/reps/weight to a
//    cardiovascular-strain equivalent — WHOOP's own muscular load runs velocity-based algorithms
//    over strap accelerometer/gyroscope under an unpublished model — and deriving one here is the
//    exact case `CLAUDE.md` warns about after the withdrawn PPG->HR estimate (#194).
//
//  • Per-exercise muscle weightings ("bench press = 0.7 triceps"). There is no published table to
//    take them from. Inventing one would make every downstream per-muscle figure fiction wearing
//    the costume of precision. The direct/indirect split is the resolution the evidence supports.
//
//  • Acute:chronic workload ratios or any injury-risk / overtraining warning. The construct's
//    validity is actively disputed, and a health warning from a non-medical app is either ignored
//    or believed — both bad.
