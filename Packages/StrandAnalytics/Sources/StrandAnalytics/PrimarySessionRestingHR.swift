/// #1169: a shadow resting-HR definition — the arithmetic MEAN of valid HR samples in the longest
/// (primary) sleep session, rather than the five-minute floor `AnalyticsEngine` ships today.
///
/// ## Why (issue #1169, artemc)
/// The original daily RHR took the minimum floor across sessions, letting a short low-HR nap replace
/// the main overnight session. A clean-room,
/// single-participant 5-night experiment (official WHOOP RHR + a Polar H10 ECG mean as independent
/// references, a pre-declared dev/holdout split, no fitted offset) found the primary-session sample mean
/// tracked both references far better: rounded MAE vs the official target 6.0→2.0 (dev) / 7.5→0.8 (holdout).
///
/// ## Shadow metric after #2522
/// #2358 temporarily wired this mean into the daily headline while selecting the primary session to
/// avoid the nap problem. #2522 keeps that session selection but takes its existing five-minute floor.
/// This mean remains in `rhr_primary_session` for comparison and does not feed scoring.
///
/// What that means for the evidence below: the MAE figures are from ONE participant over five nights against
/// a pre-declared split, which is the holdout the issue says is not yet large enough. #2284 proposes
/// changing a session's `restingHR` definition separately; this shadow comparison does not enact it.
///
/// ## Definition (documented per the issue)
/// - **Primary session**: the LONGEST session by duration; ties resolve to the FIRST (stable). A shorter nap
///   never replaces the main night — the selection rule now used by the shipped daily RHR too.
/// - **Valid sample**: bpm within `validBpm` (default 30…220, matching `AnalyticsEngine`'s worn-HR range).
///   Anything outside the range — or a missing sample (simply absent from the array) — is excluded.
/// - **Mean**: the arithmetic SAMPLE mean (unweighted). The experiment validated the sample mean; a
///   time-weighted variant behaves differently under irregular cadence and must be evaluated separately.
/// - **Coverage**: returns `nil` unless the primary session has at least `minValidSamples` valid samples.
/// - The result is an APPROXIMATION, not a clinically validated measurement.
///
/// Twin of Kotlin `PrimarySessionRestingHR`. Keep byte-identical.
