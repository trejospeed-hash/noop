// StrainScorer.swift — cardiovascular load on a 0–100 logarithmic strain ("Effort") scale.
//
// Ported from server/ingest/app/analysis/strain.py. INDEPENDENT implementation of
// published exercise-physiology methods (WHOOP-*like*, not a reproduction of the
// proprietary algorithm; not medical advice).
//
// Scale note: the metric was historically 0–21 (WHOOP's Strain axis); the
// "Charge / Effort / Rest" redesign rescales the OUTPUT to 0–100 by raising
// `maxStrain` 21.0 → 100.0 only. The denominator D = 7201 is unchanged, so the log
// curve and its saturation point (TRIMP 7200 ≈ max) are preserved — a max Effort day
// stays as rare as a 21.0 day used to be. Internal metric key stays `strain`.
//
// Pipeline:
//   1. Heart-Rate Reserve (Karvonen): HRR = HRmax − RHR.
//   2. Per-sample intensity as %HRR = (HR − RHR) / HRR × 100, clamped 0..100.
//   3. TRIMP accumulated over the window:
//        a. Edwards 5-zone summation (default): sample contributes its zone weight
//           (1..5 at 50/60/70/80/90 %HRR cut-offs) × duration.
//        b. Banister exponential: sample contributes duration × x × 0.64 × e^(b·x).
//   4. Logarithmic compression onto [0, 100]:
//        strain = 100 × ln(TRIMP + 1) / ln(D)
//      D belongs to the METHOD, not to the scorer: Edwards uses `strainDenominator` (7201, from its
//      sex-independent 7200 ceiling), Banister its own sex-dependent ceiling + 1. See
//      `logMapDenominator(method:sex:)` — reusing one for the other silently rescales the axis (#1545).
//
// References: Karvonen 1957 (%HRR); Edwards 1993 (5-zone TRIMP); Banister 1991
// (exponential TRIMP, b = 1.92 men / 1.67 women); Tanaka 2001 (HRmax = 208 − 0.7×age).
