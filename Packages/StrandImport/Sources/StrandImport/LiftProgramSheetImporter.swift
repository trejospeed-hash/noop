// Build a Lift Log PROGRAM from a spreadsheet filled in on a computer.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. A program is a name plus an ordered list of exercise lines, and every line carries
// an exercise, a muscle classification, sets, reps, a weight, a rest period and a technique note.
// Typing all of that on a phone, for a dozen exercises, is the single most tedious thing in the
// feature — and it is exactly the kind of work a spreadsheet on a real keyboard is good at.
//
// This reads the filled-in sheet and produces programs. It never writes: the caller decides what to
// do with the result, which keeps this parser pure and testable with no store and no app.
//
// TWO FORMATS, ONE PARSER. `.xlsx` is what the shipped template is, because a spreadsheet can lock
// its own structure and offer the muscle vocabulary as a dropdown — the user cannot mistype a muscle
// name that has to match a closed token set. CSV is accepted too, because every spreadsheet program
// on every platform can save it, and because a user who rebuilds the sheet by hand should not be
// blocked. Detection is by ZIP magic bytes, the same way `DataBackup` tells a zipped backup from a
// bare SQLite file.

/// One exercise line read from the sheet — the TARGETS, mirroring `liftProgramItem`.
