// MARK: - v45 store: the in-app strength log (programs, sessions, sets)
//
// Mirrors the established LabMarkerStore / AppleStepHourStore idiom precisely: plain Codable row
// structs, raw `Row` fetch + manual decode, idempotent upserts keyed by the natural key, all GRDB
// work through the actor's `syncWrite` / `syncRead` helpers.
//
// The four tables are flat and deviceId-keyed, joined manually by id — this schema carries no
// foreign keys. A logged session also exists as an ordinary `workout` row; the two find each other
// through the workout table's natural key (deviceId, startTs, sport), which `liftSession` pins with
// a UNIQUE index.
//
// Nothing here computes or stores a load score. `workout.strain` remains the HR-measured number the
// analytics engine produces; volume is derived on read from the sets, where the arithmetic is
// visible (`LiftSetRow.volumeKg`).
